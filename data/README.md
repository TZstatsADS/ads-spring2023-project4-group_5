### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

 - compas-scores-two-years.csv: The dataset we our project on
 - compas_scores_two_years_encoded.csv: The clean and encoded dataset
