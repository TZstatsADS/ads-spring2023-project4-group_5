### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

- clr.py: code for logistic regression under constraints
- csvm.py: code for the training SVM under constraints
- helper.py: code for helper functions
- loss_function.py: code for different loss functions that can be used to train models
