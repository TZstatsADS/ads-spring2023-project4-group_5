+ Project summary: The project is about building a comprehensive introduction to image classification using CNNs and demonstrates how to build and evaluate a model using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The project uses the Company Analysis dataset. In this project, we firstly did some data wrangling and then built a SVM model and a logistic model. Nextly, we set fairness constriants and evaluated each models on the test set, and its performance is analyzed using various metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix.
	

**Contribution statement**: 
All six of us contributed equally in the project. We worked together on feature selection, data cleaning, and data wrangling. After finalize the cleaned data, we split the group into 2 mini-groups. Weijie Xia, Mingzi Xu, Sherry Ren mainly worked on A2 paper and its algorithm, while Jiahao Wei, Luke Arceneaux, Yiming Zhu worked on A6. After building the models, we always meet on ZOOM to discuss the algorithm and code. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement.
