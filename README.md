+ Project summary: The project is about building a comprehensive introduction to image classification using CNNs and demonstrates how to build and evaluate a model using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The project uses the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of 10 different types of clothing items. In this project, we built a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify these images. Then we evaluated each models on the test set, and its performance is analyzed using various metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. We also includes additional sections for experimenting with different model architectures and hyperparameters, as well as visualizing some of the misclassified images to gain insights into potential areas for improvement.
